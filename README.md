# Cryptocurrencies

Clustering Cryptocurrencies for potential portfolio offerings with Unsupervised Machine Learning Models

The data used in this project was the crypto_data.csv from [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist)

## Purpose



## Preprocessing the Data for PCA

 
- Removed all cryptocurrencies that are not currently being traded. 

- Dropped the 'Is Trading' column.

- Removed all rows that had at least one null value.

- Removed all rows that did not have coins being mined.

- Created a new DataFrame to store all cryptocurrency names from the 'CoinName' columnn and retains the index from the crypto_df DataFram.

- Dropped the 'CoinName' column from the crypto_df.

- Used the get_dummies() method to create variables for the text features in the 'Algorithm' and 'ProofType' columnns and then stored them in a new DataFrame, X.

- Used the StandardScaler fit_transform() function to standardize the features from the X DataFrame.

## Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

- Applied PCA to reduce the dimensions to three principal components.

- Created a new DataFrame named pcs_df that includes the columns PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3, and uses the index of the crypto_df DataFrame as the index.

## Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

- Created an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K with the pcs_df DataFrame.

- Used the pcs_df DataFrame to run the K-means algorithm to make predictions of the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.

- Created a new DataFrame named clustered_df by concatenating the crypto_df and pcs_df DataFrames on the same columns with the same index as the crypto_df DataFrame.

- Add the 'CoinName' column that holds the names of the cryptocurrencies from the coin names df created above to the clustered_df.

- Added another new column to the clustered_df named 'Class' that holds the predictions.

## Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

- Created a 3D scatter plot using the Plotly Express scatter_3d() function to plot the three clusters from the clustered_df DataFrame.

- Add the CoinName and Algorithm columns to the hover_name and hover_data parameters, respectively, so each data point shows the CoinName and Algorithm on hover.

-  I also added the TotalCoinSupply and TotalCoinsMined data to the hover_data parameters.

- Created a table with tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.

- Printed the total number of tradable cryptocurrencies in the clustered_df DataFrame.

- Used the MinMaxScaler().fit_transform method to scale the TotalCoinSupply and TotalCoinsMined columns between the given range of zero and one.

- Created a new DataFrame using the clustered_df DataFrame index that contains the MinMax scaled data.

- Added the 'CoinName' and 'Class' columns from the clustered_df DataFrame to the new DataFrame.

- Created an hvplot scatter plot with x="TotalCoinsMined", y="TotalCoinSupply", and by="Class" that shows the CoinName upon data point hover.
